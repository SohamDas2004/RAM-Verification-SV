# ðŸ§  32 bit RAM Verification using SV Testbench (in progress)

This repo contains a verification environment for a custom 32RAM design using **SystemVerilog**. The goal of this project was to validate the functionality of a synchronous RAM using a modular and reusable testbench architecture.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- ðŸ›  **Design**: A parameterized RAM module with read/write enable, address decoding, and synchronous reset.
- âœ… **Verification**: Testbench developed in SystemVerilog with constrained-random stimulus and functional coverage.
- ðŸ“Š **Outputs**: Waveform analysis and code/functional coverage reports.
- ðŸ§ª **Test Strategy**: Includes directed and random tests for edge cases such as:
  - Read-before-write
  - Write enable glitches
  - Out-of-bound addresses
  - Reset behavior
